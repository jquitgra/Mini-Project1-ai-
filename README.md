Project description:
Mini-Project 1: Search

In this mini-project, your task is to implement general-purpose search algorithms and use them in solving maze problems. 
More concretely, you will program an agent to find a path through the maze and reach the exit.

Your program should run using Python 3.7. Your code can only import extra modules, 
but only if they are part of the standard python library.

Your program will solve the problem of finding the shortest path given an initial start state and one goal state. 
The maze layout will be provided as a simple text file, in which '%' means obstacles, 'P' is the starting position,
and '.' represents the goal.

My solution:
I solve this problem by implementing a Depth-first, Breath-first, Greedy-best-first, and A-star search algorithms to find
a path from the start of the maze to the end of the maze.
